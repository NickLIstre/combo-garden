<h1>About Us</h1>

<p> Hi! My name is Nyko (<i>or Nick if you know me irl</i>)</p>
<p> I am the founder of Black Baccara Productions and also the only member!</p><br>
<p> I am a solo developer who has been working on this project for a while now. My goal is to 
    create a way for lovers of fighting games to easily find combos for their favorite characters.</p><br>
<p> I started this project because I noticed that each fighting game has its own unique way and place to find
    combos, and it can be difficult to find a consistent format across different games. I wanted to create
    a platform that would make it easy for players to find and learn combos, regardless of the game they are playing.</p><br>
<p> This is my first time creating a website from scratch so things are not as clean as I would like them to be. 
    I plan on revamping the site in the future to allow for users to upload their own combos and create accounts.</p><br>
<p> I love making things interactive and accessible so look forward to improvements in the future such as combos of the month, 
    profile customization, and more!
</p><br>
<p> I am always open to feedback and suggestions, so please feel free to reach out to me through the
    <a href="../pages/Contact.html">Contact</a> page if you have any ideas or questions!</p><br>
<p> Thank you for visiting Combo Garden! I hope you find it useful and enjoyable.</p><br>
