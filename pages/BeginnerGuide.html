		<h1>Beginner Guide</h1>
		<p><b>Fighting games can be very intimidating for newcomers to the genre so here is a guide for people who are interested but are maybe overwhelmed by all the terminology and things that everyone keeps using.</p>
		<p>You can keep coming back to this as needed whenever there is something that is confusing. Additional links to other helpful resources will be provided at the bottom of the page so please take your time and have a look around and we hope you enjoy your journey down the fighting game path!</b></p>

		<h2>Mentality</h2>
		<p>One of the most important but also most overlooked aspects of any competitive game is the mental aspect involved. When you jump into a new game you're going to want to win, that goes without saying, but winning in fighting games can be very hard so its important to think about the conditions you need to win and which playstyle suits you the best. Think of fighting games as a sport that you will progressively get better at as you get more experience. Every top athlete started off with a ball and a general idea of "I need to get this to go there". Using soccer/football as an example, when you're starting out you will probably just try to get the ball from your opponent and run to the other side before your opponent can catch you. You don't need to learn all the nuances before you learn the basics. You should focus on having fun and pressing buttons that do cool things and from there learn a couple basic combos and start playing. As you fight against more people you will start to learn when you can do different things and which things work where so you should look at every game as a learning opportunity. Even pro players still find new things that work in different situations and when they lose they look at what they could have done differently and try to do that  next time. A lot of fighting games do not have rewards for ranking up other than just a letter or title on your profile. Hitting a high rank can be a fun thing to achieve and to keep track of your improvement but it is important to not care too much where you are as if you have fun and learn from your mistakes, your rank will naturally climb with you.</p>

<h2>What To Play</h2>
<p>There are a lot of fighting games on the market and they're pretty expensive to get into if you're not sure if you'll even enjoy them so finding the one that better suits what you enjoy will be key to helping you not only have fun but also get better. The good thing is no matter which game you play, the core fundamentals will stick with you so once you break through the initial barrier, it will be easy to jump right into any fighting game that catches your eye and be able to pick up and play. There are a few subgenres of fighting games that help distinguish between the unique mechanics involved that some may prefer over others. These subgenres include:
<h3>2D</h3>
    <ul><li>Street Fighter 6</li></ul>
<h3>3D</h3>
    <ul><li>Tekken 6</li></ul>
<h3>Platform</h3>
    <ul><li>Super Smash Bros Ultimate</li>
    <li>Brawlhalla</li></ul>
<h3>Tag Team</h3>
    <ul><li>2XKO</li>
    <li>Dragon Ball FighterZ</li>
    <li>Marvel vs Capcom</li></ul>
<h3>Arena</h3>
    <ul><li>Dragon Ball Sparking Zero</li>
    <li>Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm Connections</li></ul>
<h3>Anime</h3>
    <ul><li>Guilty Gear Xrd Rev 2</li>
    <li>Guilty Gear Strive</li>
    <li>Melty Blood</li>
    <li>Dragon Ball FighterZ</li></ul>

<h2> Who To Play </h2>
<p>There are different major archetypes that fit different characters which can help you figure out which playstyle you prefer. If you end up enjoying a major archetype of character over others, then finding a main in other games will be a lot easier.</p>
		<h3>Rushdown</h3>
                      <ul><li>Aggressive. Skip neutral and try to stay in opponents face and keep them on the defensive.</li>
                      <li>Examples: Chipp-Guilty Gear, Lancelot-Granblue, Bardock-Dragon Ball FighterZ</li></ul>
                <h3>Zoner</h3>
                      <ul><li>Long-range pokes. Keep enemy from getting in. Usually weak at close-range so game plan is to poke at a distance and keep opponent as far away as possible.</li>
                      <li>Examples: Dhalsim-Street Fighter, Axl Low-Guilty Gear, Metera-Granblue</li></ul>
                <h3>Shoto</h3>
                      <ul><li>The "fundamentals" character, usually with a well-rounded kit that allows for different approaches. Usually easier to pick up and learn. The well-rounded kit allows for more neutral play and a good learning opportunity for new players to pick up on different mechanics.</li>
                      <li>Typically characterized by having a fireball, an anti-air uppercut (shoryuken/dp), and a fast, close-range attack (tatsu).</li>
                      <li>Examples: Ryu/Ken-Street Fighter, Ky-Guilty Gear, Gran/Djeeta-Granblue</li></ul>
                <h3>Grappler</h3>
                      <ul><li>Playstyle similar to wrestlers. Grapplers whole kit usually involves multiple unblockable grab attacks that deal a lot of damage when pulled off. Typically slower to compensate for great damage and unblockable moves.</li>
                      <li>Examples: Zangief-Street Fighter, King-Tekken, Potemkin-Guilty Gear</li></ul>
                <h3>Puppet</h3>
                      <ul><li>Controls 2 characters at once. Much more complex and harder to learn as you need to manage 2 characters on the screen at the same time, however once mastered become very challenging to deal with and flashy as the opponent will have to be careful of both.</li>
                      <li>Examples: Zato-Guilty Gear, Nier-Granblue, Carl Clover-BlazBlue</li></ul>
                <h3>Stance</h3>
<p>These are not set in stone and the playstyle can be different within the major archetypes but this provides a general understanding of the archetypes. Some of the sub-archetypes that can fit into each of these styles are:</p>
                <h3>Mix-up</h3>
                       <ul><li>Uses lots of moves to deceive the opponent and get them to block in the opposite direction in order to sneak a hit in. There are high-low mixups and left-right mixups which just represent the direction that are you able to make the opponent guess between when attacking.</li>
                       <li>Lancelot from Granblue Fantasy Versus is a good example of this as he has the ability to dash at the opponent and choose between 4 different options that the opponent has no way of reacting to. His dash can be stopped early to attack directly from the front, pressed again to go behind the opponent to attack the other side, press back to quickly move in and out of pressure to bait attacks, or press up to teleport above the opponent and attack high.</li>
